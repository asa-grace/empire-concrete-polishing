                    We are located in Utah County. We provide our service within the Inter-Mountain West.  We specialize in concrete polishing, coatings, concrete restoration and concrete leveling.  Let us help you create the floor you have been dreaming of.

                    "I had experience working in this industry for 4 years before deciding I could provide better service, better finished product, and a better customer experience under my own company." Empire Concrete Polishing was founded in 2016 by Damien Hubert.

                    We are based in Utah County. We are able to provide services anywhere within a 500 mile radius including Southern Idaho, Western Colorado, Wyoming, Nevada, Northern Arizona.

                    We specialize in concrete polishing but we are damn good at coatings (epoxy, waterproofing, garage coatings, urethane, slurry systems, MMA) and we are the guys that get called when other companies have made a mess of things. We are the only company in the Inter-Mountain West that provides exceptional concrete leveling to 1/8″ on 10′ – adequate to install wood flooring and VCT flooring.

                    In addition to being able to create gorgeous flooring, we pride ourselves on being able to provide our service with zero babysitting required. Call us and schedule an estimate. We will take care of things from there.
